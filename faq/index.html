          When You Receive Your Visa?
It depends on the country issuing the visa. For many countries such as Australia ETA and Turkey e-Visa, the process can be done in 15 minutes through our rush service.

The documents must be printed on a sheet of blank A4 white paper. Double-side or reduced printing will not be accepted.
What should I do if my e-Visa is lost, defaced or damaged?
You may reprint the e-Visa in your email account. Alternatively, you may retrieve and reprint the e-Visa

If approved, does this guarantee my admission to the country I am applying for?
All visas grant travelers the permission to travel to a country's port of entry. Whether you are granted entry or not will be at the discretion of the Immigration Officer at the entry point.
Does the processing times for a visa include shipping times?
When the visa has to be shipped to you, the processing times do not include this shipping time. It is from when Ivisabd receive your application to obtaining the approval. Most visas (e-Visas) are sent via email upon approval so shipping times will not apply.

Are you affiliated with any of the governments that you process visas for?
No, Ivisabd are not affiliated with any government agencies. Ivisabd are a private company that specializes in processing travel visas for travelers worldwide.

If my visa is not approved, can you tell me the reason?
Unfortunately, Ivisabd are not able to, since the government agencies do not inform us of the reason(s) behind the decisions.

I made a mistake on my personal information when processing the visa. Can I modify the form?
If Ivisabd have not processed your visa, Ivisabd can make changes without a problem. Ivisabd do check your information for mistakes as well. If you have already processed your visa, If Ivisabd have submitted your application to the appropriate government agencies, some will allow to make changes, while others do not.

Why does Ivisabd charge a service fee?
Please note most countries offer the ability to process a travel visa without a service fee. The main reason Ivisabd process thousands of travel visas per month is Ivisabd save you time and frustration. Our service includes an easy to use website and application form. It is much easier to process your application with us especially for mobile users and large groups. Ivisabd send all of our clients the visa days before travel.

Ivisabd also have a 24-hour customer service with professionals that are based in the United States and speak English. Ivisabd accept multi-currencies and our website can be translated into over 20 languages. Ivisabd believe our fee is worth your time and sanity but please note all governments do have their own "free" service.

If my visa is rejected, do I receive a refund?
If your visa application is not approved by the government agency, we will provide a full refund of all service fees under our approval guarantee. We cannot refund the visa fee (if applicable) since this is a third party fee that is paid directly to the government agency. If a mistake is made on your application, Ivisabd will process your visa again at no cost. Please note refunds are credited back to the same credit card used.


If I wish to cancel my visa application, do I receive a refund?
